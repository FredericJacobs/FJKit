=====

This repository groups some categories on top of UIKit and custom classes that I'm using in every single iOS project.

There is more to it but the rest needs to be cleaned up before being open sourced.

Depending on the project needs, I import :

- [AFNetworking](http://afnetworking.org/)
- [ISO8601DateFormatter](http://boredzo.org/iso8601unparser/)
- [MagicalRecord](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord)
